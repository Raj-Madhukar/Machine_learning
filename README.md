A collection of Machine learning algorithms, models, and real-world projects implemented in python with Jupyter Notebooks. 
# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!  
This repo contains my learning journey, projects, and experiments using various *machine learning algorithms* implemented in *Python* with *Jupyter Notebook*.

---

## 🚀 About
This repository is created to practice and understand core Machine Learning concepts step by step — from basic regression to advanced neural networks.
The goal is to gain hands-on experience by working with real datasets from *Kaggle* and other open data sources.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree and Random Forest  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Neural Networks (using TensorFlow / Keras)  

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- *Language:* Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
